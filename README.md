# shoppinglist
A shopping list made for my family. More info can be found on [this page](https://robin.heidenis.com/projects/shoppinglist)
It uses Reactjs and uses an [Express backend](https://github.com/RobinHeidenis/Shopping-List-Backend). For authentication I wrote my own [jwt authentication server](https://github.com/RobinHeidenis/auth).
