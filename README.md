# shoppinglist

A shopping list made for my family. More info can be found
on [this page](https://robin.heidenis.com/projects/shoppinglist)
It uses Reactjs and uses an [Express backend](https://github.com/RobinHeidenis/Shopping-List-Backend). For
authentication I wrote my own [jwt authentication server](https://github.com/RobinHeidenis/auth).

If you want to run this project yourself, clone these three repositories and run them using `npm start`.

## JsDoc

Some JsDoc blocks include `<br/>` tags. This is because of [this](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-49329) issue.
The issue doesn't render newlines for methods that don't have any methods.
